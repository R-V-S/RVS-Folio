      <h2>Hi. </h2><p>I'm Rajeev V. Singh, a web developer in the Boston metro area.</p>
        <div class="flex-me">
          <div class="flex-column">
            <p><i>Here's what you need to know about me, in a nutshell:</i></p>
            <ol>
              <li>I am a <strong>designer</strong> as well as a <strong>developer</strong>, so I'm
                just as comfortable in <strong>Photoshop</strong> or <strong>Illustrator</strong>
                as I am in a text editor (currently enjoying <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>) or
                a terminal.</li>
              <li>I love <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Consequently, I love modern JS-based tools
                like <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>React.js</strong>. I'm also very much
                at home using <strong>jQuery</strong>.</li>
              <li>I have 6 years of experience writing themes and modules/plugins for <strong>Drupal</strong>
                and <strong>WordPress</strong> in <strong>PHP</strong>.</li>
              <li>I've written front-ends for <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> from the ground up, using
                React.js to provide a slick, modern user experience.</li>
              <li>I prioritize <strong>web accessibility</strong>. I test my work with Apple VoiceOver, and
                I include users of screen readers in UX tests.</li>
              <li>I've worked with <strong>RESTful API's</strong>, writing code for clients
                pulling data from social media networks, as well as for servers fulfilling requests.</li>
              <li>I have worked in (and have fostered) an <strong>agile</strong> working environment, and I believe
                that agile process management works. I do also think it's OK to adapt agile methods to suit
                a team's strengths and weaknesses.</li>
              <li>I am good with <strong>documentation</strong>. I use self-explanatory variable names,
                inline comments, and Evernote notebooks to assist anyone that may need to understand or
                modify my work.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-column">
            <p><i>And here's what I'm looking for:</i></p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>100% remote work.</strong> I respect the decision of employers that require office
                time from their employees, but I believe that remote work is the best option for professionals
                that are independently productive and vested in the quality of their work.</li>
              <li><strong>Contract or part-time employment.</strong> I'm involved in several projects already
                (some of them my own endeavors), so I don't feel that full-time employment is a good fit for
                at the moment.</li>
              <li><strong>Work that resonates with me.</strong> If you represent a <strong>non-profit</strong>,
                or if your work is related to <strong>music</strong>, <strong>3D printing</strong>,
                <strong>microchips/IoT</strong> (I use the
                <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a>), or
                <strong>casual games</strong>, then I'd like to hear from you.</li>
              <li><strong>Great written communication.</strong> I believe that the key to a great,
                smoothly executed project is in excellent written communication amongst all parties involved.</li>
            </ol>

      <h2>Berklee College of Music Homepage</h2>

      <p>In 2014, Berklee was faced with an all-too-common issue amongst colleges.
        They had too much to say and too little space to say it on their existing homepage.
        As part of an overall theme/design update, I was asked to completely rethink the homepage.
        I formulated objectives for the homepage overhaul that were based on my own philosophy on web UX and design.
        Those objectives were:
