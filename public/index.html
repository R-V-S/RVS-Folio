          <h2>Hi. </h2><p>I'm Raj, a coder and designer living in the Boston metro area.
          I'm looking for contract or part-time work that is 100% remote. If you represent a non-profit,
            or if your work is related to music, 3D printing, microchips/IoT (I use
            the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a>), or casual games, then I'd especially
            like to <a href="mailto:rajeev.v.singh@gmail.com" target="_blank">hear from you</a>. This is what I offer: </p>

              <h3>Code and Design</h3>
              <img class="illustration" src="images/illustration-code.png" alt="" />
              <p>While I usually find myself employed as a front-end developer, I'm almost always utilized for
                back-end coding and design work as well. I'm known for being just as comfortable in Photoshop
                and Illustrator as I am in a text editor (currently enjoying <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>)
                or a terminal.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>JavaScript Wizardry</h3>
              <img class="illustration" src="images/illustration-javascript.png" alt="" />
              <p>With the rising popularity of Node.js, JavaScript is poised to be one of the most pervasive and flexible
                languages in use. It can be used to build back-ends (Node.js), asynchronous front-ends (React.js,
                Socket.io, Angular.js), cross-platform desktop apps (NW.js), and mobile devices (Cordova and JXCore).
                I specialize in JS, particularly Node.js and ECMAScript 2015, and I'm
                excited about the direction the language is headed.
              </p>
            </li>

              <h3>CMS Theming and Module Development</h3>
              <img class="illustration" src="images/illustration-drupal.png" alt="" />
               <p>I first began working with WordPress while working for an ad agency. It was easy to
                 install, easy for clients to learn, and easy to modify. As the scope of my projects became
                 more complex and as the organizations I worked for became
                 larger and more complex as well, I began working with Drupal. I've since spent years
                 writing themes (both base and child) and modules for Drupal.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Ruby on Rails Front-end Development</h3>
              <img class="illustration" src="images/illustration-rails.png" alt="" />
               <p>While I'm not a Rails expert, I've had the opportunity to work on several large Rails
                 projects. Most recently, I designed and developed a complex front-end for Rails from the ground
                 up using React.js.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Web Accessibility</h3>
              <img class="illustration" src="images/illustration-accessibility.png" alt="" />
              <p>I believe that the web is for everyone, and everyone benefits from a more accessible
                web. Changes to the web that benefit accessibility almost always have other
                benefits. Content that can be read by screen readers to the visually impaired can also
                be read by Siri to someone driving to work in the morning, for example. I test my work with Apple VoiceOver before
                publishing and I include users of screen readers in UX tests when possible. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Custom API interactions</h3>
              <img class="illustration" src="images/illustration-api.png" alt="" />
              <p>Interacting with third-party data providers is part of the web we live in.
                I specialize in the custom development of tools/plugins/modules
                that push and pull data from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo, Flickr, and Google Maps.
                I've also set up server-side APIs in Drupal and Rails to facilitate server-to-server communication.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>An Agile Approach</h3>
              <img class="illustration" src="images/illustration-agile.png" alt="" />
              <p>I was first introduced to agile management in 2012, and I've since adopted the agile philosophy for
                virtually everything. I've used it on team projects that I've led, I've pushed for it to be adopted
                by teams that I've worked on (and succeeded), and I even use it on my personal projects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Robust documentation.</h3>
              <img class="illustration" src="images/illustration-documentation.png" alt="" />
              <p>Code isn't worth much if it can't be understood and modified by other programmers. As a consequence,
                I use self-explanatory variable names and include comments in my code, and for larger
                projects, I write and organize separate documentation <em>simulateously as I code</em>. There, I
                cover the things that don't fit into code comments: Why I made certain decisions, how future
                modifications can be made, and where things can be found in the code.</p>

               class="pannable"
               data-height="300px" />
          <p>As chief web designer and senior front-end developer, I spearheaded a comprehensive design and
            front-end upgrade to Berklee's site. Specifically: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>I outlined the requirements for an updated UI.</li>
              <li>I created wireframes to represent the new UI.</li>
              <li>I created design mock-ups in PhotoShop and Illustrator.</li>
              <li>I acted as an advocate for users while negotiating with stakeholders.
                My goal was to strike a balance between business objectives and user goals.</li>
              <li>I developed a Drupal parent theme and several Drupal child themes.</li>
              <li>I worked with our project manager to devise and implement unbiased user tests.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Jenna Claire</h3>
          <img src="images/screenshots/jenna-claire-homepage.png" />
          <p>I was contracted by Jenna Claire Handbag Studio in 2009 to completely rebuild and redesign
            their site. I was the sole web designer and developer on the project (though some graphical elements,
            including their logo, had already been created by a graphic designer). Together, we created a fun
            site with an interactive handbag design tool. I built the
            site in WordPress and created a modules that would allow Jenna Claire to add/modify handbags to
            the interactive designer without developer assistance.</p>
          <p>Users could choose from a range of fabrics for each
          individual section of the handbag and the image would update automatically. Lighting and shading
          would also be calculated.</p>
          <p>Although this work suffers from age (I would approach this problem
            very differently today), I feel it was ahead of its time in 2009.  This was years before nike.com introduced
            their custom shoe designer, and I feel that my code resulting in more realistic shading. </p>

          <img src="images/screenshots/litwitkit-homepage-v1a.png"
              class="pannable"
              data-height="300px" />
          <p>LitWitKit was a nice departure from the gray and red color palette of Berklee. I designed the
            site, created the illustrations (which make use of SVG.JS for fun little
            animations on mouse hover), and developed the site (back-end and front-end). I used Node.JS along
            with Socket.io for data synchronization and Mongoose (MongoDB) as a database.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Berklee Hub</h3>
          <img src="images/screenshots/berklee-hub-screenshot-smaller.png"
               class="pannable"
               data-height="300px" />
          <p>The Berklee Hub is a notification center that pulls in student data across the campus
            and allows students to filter and customize the content they receive. It was built in
            Rails by a team of three. I was responsible for design and front-end development. I built the front-end
            using React.JS and assisted with the back-end as needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Drupal Modules</h3>
          <img src="images/screenshots/berklee-off-canvas-menu-and-auto-complete.png" />
          <p>I've written over a dozen Drupal modules to either fulfill needs not covered by existing
          modules (at the time of their development), or to provide a tailored user experience.
          Some highlights include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Smart Autocomplete (shown above), which supplements a search field with a filterable list of
              node titles.</li>
            <li>Menu Fields, which allows fields to be added to menus and menu items</li>
            <li>Social Media Manager, which allows content admins to easily manage social media accounts
              related to the site, and to inject social media feeds into blocks and pages. </li>
            <li>WYSIWYG Filters, which provides content managers with added flexibility in
              controlling the look, feel, and behavior of content</li>
            <li>Advanced Contextual Filters, which adds contextual filters to Views for Workbench
              Access, Role-based Visibility, advanced Date/time specifications, pager overrides,
              and more.</li>
            <li>Menu Visibility, which allows granular control of menu item visibility based on
              user role and Workbench Access settings.</li>
            <li>Embedded Help, which allows tooltips and slide-out drawers for supplementary help to
              be added to any field in the admin interface.</li>
            <li>Content Share, which sets up an API for responding to API requests for block, content,
              and menu data. Returns user-specific data, when possible.</li>
            <li>Workbench Access Menus, which allows menus to be assigned to Workbench Access Sections.
              Works in conjunction with Menu Visibility, Workbench Access, and Menu Fields to create
              a highly individualized user experience.</li>
            <li>Node Info Block, which displays node information on a rendered page in a slide-out
              drawer, for easy access to non-visible details like node ID and hidden taxonomy terms.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Berklee Today</h3>
          <img src="images/screenshots/berklee-today-spring-2014.png"
               class="pannable"
               data-height="300px" />
          <p>Berklee's magazine was – and still is – primarily designed for print. The challenge
            presented to the Digital Strategy team at Berklee was to adapt that print content into
            something that would work on the web. The project passed through many hands until it landed
            with me, and I did my best to create a design that remained true to the original print version
            but didn't bake artifacts from the original print design into the web UI/design.</p>
          <p>I also handled all development related to the project, including Views-driven menus that
            take advantage of contextual filters and an automated layout system based on article tagging.</p>
