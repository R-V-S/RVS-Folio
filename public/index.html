          <h2>Hi. </h2><p>I'm Raj, a coder and designer living in the Boston metro area.
          I'm looking for contract or part-time work that is 100% remote. If you represent a non-profit,
            or if your work is related to music, 3D printing, microchips/IoT (I use
            the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a>), or casual games, then I'd especially
            like to <a href="mailto:rajeev.v.singh@gmail.com" target="_blank">hear from you</a>. This is what I offer: </p>

              <h3>Code and Design</h3>
              <img src="images/illustration-code.png" alt="" />
              <p>While I usually find myself employed as a front-end developer, I'm almost always utilized for
                back-end coding and design work as well. I'm known for being just as comfortable in Photoshop
                and Illustrator as I am in a text editor (currently enjoying <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>)
                or a terminal.

              <h3>JavaScript Wizardry</h3>
              <img src="images/illustration-javascript.png" alt="" />
              <p>With the rising popularity of Node.js, JavaScript is poised to be one of the most pervasive and flexible
                languages in use. It can be used to build web back-ends (Node.js), data-binding front-ends (React.js,
                Socket.io, etc.), cross-platform desktop apps (NW.js), and mobile devices (Cordova and JXCore).

              <h3>CMS Theming and Module Development</h3>
              <img src="images/illustration-drupal.png" alt="" />
               <p>I first began working with WordPress while working for an ad agency. It was easy to
                 install, easy for clients to learn, and easy to modify. As the scope of my projects became
                 more complex and as the organizations I worked for became
                 larger and more complex as well, I began working with Drupal. I've since spent years
                 writing themes (parent and child) and modules for Drupal.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Ruby on Rails Front-end Development</h3>
              <img src="images/illustration-rails.png" alt="" />
               <p>While I'm not a Rails expert, I've had the opportunity to work on several large Rails
                 projects. Most recently, I designed and developed a complex front-end for Rails from the ground
                 up using React.js.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Web Accessibility</h3>
              <img src="images/illustration-accessibility.png" alt="" />
              <p>I believe that the web is for everyone, and everyone benefits from a more accessible
                web. Changes to the web that benefit accessibility almost always have other
                benefits. Content that can be read by screen readers to the visually impaired can also
                be read by Siri to someone driving to work in the morning, for example. I test my work with Apple VoiceOver before
                publishing and I include users of screen readers in UX tests when possible. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Custom API interactions</h3>
              <img src="images/illustration-api.png" alt="" />
              <p>It's hard to get very far into web development without having to interact with third-party
                data providers. I specialize in the custom development of tools/plugins/modules
                that push and pull data from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo, Flickr, and Google Maps.
                I've also set up server-side APIs in Drupal and Rails so that those sites can fulfill client requests.</p>
            </li>

              <h3>An Agile Approach</h3>
              <img src="images/illustration-agile.png" alt="" />
              <p>I was first introduced to agile management in 2012, and I've since adopted the agile philosophy for
                virtually everything. I've used it on team projects that I've led, I've pushed for it to be adopted
                by teams that I've worked on (and succeeded), and I even use it on my personal projects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Robust documentation.</h3>
              <img src="images/illustration-documentation.png" alt="" />
              <p>Code isn't worth much if it can't be understood and modified by other programmers. As a consequence,
                I use self-explanatory variable names and include comments in my code, and for larger
                projects, I write and organize separate documentation <em>simulateously as I code</em>. There, I
                cover the things that don't fit into code comments: Why I made certain decisions, how future
                modifications can be made, and where things can be found in the code.</p>

      <p>In 2014, Berklee was faced with an all-too-common issue amongst colleges.
        They had too much to say and too little space to say it on their existing homepage.
        As part of an overall theme/design update, I was asked to completely rethink the homepage.
        I formulated objectives for the homepage overhaul that were based on my own philosophy on web UX and design.
        Those objectives were:
